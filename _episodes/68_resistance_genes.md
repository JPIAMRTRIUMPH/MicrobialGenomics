## ResFinder

[ResFinder](https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/resfinder/src/master/) is often used to find resistance genes and mutations. The output is human readable. Now that we have assembled our genome we are going to determine which resistance genes and point mutations there are. We are going to use a loop to cycle through the files. This is handy if you have multiple files to process. Resfinder is written in Python, so it must be run through that interpreter. It is often installed in its own conda environment because of it's very specific dependencies. We run it with the option --acquired for the resistance genes and --point for the resistance point mutations. __Please do not forget to activate resfinder__.

~~~
$ conda activate resfinder
$ cd ~/assembly
$ for sample in barcode02 barcode03
> do
>  python -m resfinder  -s "Escherichia coli" --point  --acquired -ifa  $sample/assembly.fasta -o $sample/resfinder
> done
$ cd barcode02
$ ls
$ cd resfinder
$ ls
$ less -S pheno_table.txt
$ less -S ResFinder_results_table.txt
$ less -S PointFinder_table.txt
$ conda deactivate
$ conda activate base
~~~
{: .bash}

The advantage of ResFinder is that it shows the phenotype associated with the resistance gene or mutations. It also shows the location of the resistance genes. The drawback is that is does not show on which contig the resistance causing point mutations are located.

## AMRFinderPlus

[AMRFinderPlus](https://github.com/ncbi/amr) is also used to find resistance genes and mutations. The output is in the form of a table. It is often installed in its own conda environment

~~~
$ cd ~/assembly
$ conda activate amrfinder
$ amrfinder --list_organisms
$ for sample in barcode02 barcode03
> do
>  amrfinder --organism Escherichia --nucleotide $sample/assembly.fasta > $sample/amrfinderplus.txt
> done
$ conda deactivate
$ conda activate base
$ cd barcode02
$ ls
$ cat amrfinderplus.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

Add the number of resistance genes to the Google sheet.

Where are the genes and where are the point mutations? Add it to the Google sheet.
